# MySQL AI with Python and Ollama

## Description  
This WIP project is a simple python script that connects to a DB and an Ollama instance to generate
an SQL query, fetch results from DB, and return the results. Accuracy depends on LLM!

## Features  
- Uses an LLM through Ollama to generate an SQL query with a constructed prompt with the DB schema
and then analyses the results to output in a human readable response
